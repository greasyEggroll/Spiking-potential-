# Spiking-potential-

This repo contains the in progress code for a paper planning to be posted on the arxiv.
We propose a layer wise calibration of large scale models such as VGG16 and ResNet and their conversion into SNNs by creating using lurking membrane potential of neurons, building on the previous shortcomings of the LIF method including data leakage and poor conversion accuracy. This code is still in progress and was posted for reference
